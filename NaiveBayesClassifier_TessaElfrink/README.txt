Programming Assignment: Naive Bayesian Text Classification
Tessa Elfrink
----------------------------------------------------------

The Naive Bayesian Text Classifier classifies files based on the words that occur within them. The classifier takes a train set to train on and a test set to use for classification. When the program is run, it shows the accuracy of the classifier.

This program can be run within a PyDev environment in Eclipse, using Python 3.5.

The program uses the nltk package, which can be downloaded from: http://www.nltk.org/install.html

To make the classifier work, the files to train the classifier on need to be placed within the 'train' directory. The files to be classified need to be placed within the 'test' directory.

To change the number of words that are used for classification, changes can be made at the bottom of the program.
